            <p>In mid-2021, I read this book while feeling lost about love. I wonderedâ€”how can people love each other so deeply and then end up hating one another? Is falling in love really that important, especially for someone like me, still a teenager at the time?</p>

            <p>One chapter in this book tells the story of interfaith love through the metaphor of a wedding car. A couple, deeply in love but from different religious backgrounds, decides to stay together. They make a deal: they will never discuss religion on their journey. They hold on tightly to their love, trying to move forward until, without realizing it, they reach a crossroad.</p>

            <p>At this crossroad, the differences they once embraced now stand in their way. They must choose a direction: one wants to turn right, the other wants to turn left. But this is not just about a roadâ€”itâ€™s about beliefs theyâ€™ve held their entire lives, far longer than their relationship.</p>

            <p>They try to compromiseâ€”turning right today, left tomorrowâ€”but over time, this becomes exhausting. They keep moving forward, but further away from the happiness they once imagined. In the end, one of them finally understands: this journey is no longer bringing joy.</p>

            <p>As the rain falls, a decision is made. One person opens the car door, steps out, and lets the other continue alone. And for the first time in a long time, there is peace. Because at that moment, they realize that all this time, they were not worshiping Godâ€”they were worshiping love itself.</p>

            <p>This book teaches us that love and faith may seem like they can go hand in hand, but in reality, one will always take precedence. So, the big question is: <strong>"If you had to choose, which matters more to youâ€”love or faith?"</strong></p>

            <p>At first, they chose love, and thatâ€™s what led them into the wedding car. But in the end, when faced with the choice between holding on or finding themselves again, they chose to step out.</p>

            <p>This book is perfect for teenagers who feel confused about love and want to be more careful when making decisions about whom to love. Through a compelling metaphor of a "wedding car," it explores how love alone isnâ€™t always enough if two people have different life directions.</p>

            <p>More than just a love story, this book teaches self-awareness, priorities, and the courage to make tough choices. Itâ€™s an eye-opening read for anyone navigating the complexities of relationships.</p>

            <p class="cta">âœ¨ Curious about what truly matters in love? Read this book and discover the answer! ðŸ’¡</p>
